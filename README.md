mips-hangman
============

Simple Hangman game implemented in the MIPS architecture for the MARS emulator. The game works just like the classic game of hangman.  The game starts with the program getting a random word from the dictionary. You then get to try and guess what the word is.  After getting 6 wrong guesses the game is over and you lose.  If you guess every character right before getting 6 wrong then you win the game.

To run it you must move the dictionary.txt file to the same directory that the mars.jar file is in.

One imitation of the program is that if you guess the same wrong character twice then you will get another incorrect guess.
